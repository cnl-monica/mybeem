# MyBeem
--------

MyBeem (an IPFIX exporter implemented in C language) represents the lowest component of the SLAmeter network traffic measurement/monitoring tool. MyBeem captures packets from the interface card and orgnaises them into flow records. Flow records are containers that carry the properties (e.g. the total number of bytes of all packets belonging to a certain flow) and characteristics (e.g. source IP address) of the flow. 

The flow records are generated by one or more metering processes. The metering process consists of a set of functions including packet capture, filtering, timestamping, sampling, classification and creating/maintaining flow records in the flow cache. Network traffic monitoring is based on the analysis of the exported flow records.

</p>


The export of flow records represents a push-based mechanism, where the data are transmitted from the exporter(s) to the IPFIX collector(s) over either the TCP, UDP or SCTP protocol.

MyBeem is in full conformity with IPFIX, Netflow and PSAMP. It is a command-line application without any GUI. It provides logging on various levels (info, warning, debug, etc.) that are shown in the terminal. MyBeem was developed using open-source technologies.
